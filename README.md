# ReadMe-Generator

#Description

A quality ReadME is a staple in getting started with coding. A ReadME will provide all information regarding the project and give others a introduction to how your project works, what work went into it, how it can be developed, and much more info. 
This project is a ReadMe generator that will prompt the user with questions and takes the user's answers as input for the generation of the ReadMe based off a template.
